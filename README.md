# How it works ?
It suffices to execute the file "main.py". Two windows will open in the browser corresponding to two tables.these tables summarize and visualize the interactions between several substances.

The first one summarizes the interactions by effect. This allows you to see all the interactions that contribute to the modulation of the same effect.

The second one summarizes the interactions by substance. This makes it possible to see if and how the bioavailability is modified to take it into account in the dosage adjustment or the possible PD interactions in which the substance will be involved.
